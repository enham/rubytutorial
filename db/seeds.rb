# This file should contain all the record creation needed to seed the database with its default values.
# The data can then be loaded with the rake db:seed (or created alongside the db with db:setup).
#
# Examples:
#
#   cities = City.create([{ name: 'Chicago' }, { name: 'Copenhagen' }])
#   Mayor.create(name: 'Emanuel', city: cities.first)

#Grantee.create(
#  name: 'Annandale Immigration Center',
#  address: '123 Little River Turnpike, Annandale, VA',
#  grant_amount: 250000,
#  grant_date: Date.parse('2014-06-09')
